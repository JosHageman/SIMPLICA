Title: Biclustering via Simplivariate Component Analysis
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: person("Jos", "Hageman", email = "jos.hageman@wur.nl", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Identifies constant, additive, multiplicative, and user-defined 
    simplivariate components in numeric data matrices using a genetic algorithm. 
    Supports flexible pattern definitions and provides visualization for 
    general biclustering applications across diverse domains. The method builds 
    on simplivariate models as introduced in Hageman et al. (2008) 
    <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0003259> and is related to biclustering 
    frameworks as reviewed by Madeira and Oliveira (2004) <doi:10.1109/TCBB.2004.2>.
