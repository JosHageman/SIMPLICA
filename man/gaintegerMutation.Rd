\title{Integer mutation operator for genetic algorithms}
\usage{
gaintegerMutation(object, parent, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A GA object containing at least the slots \code{@population},
\code{@upper}, \code{@lower}, and \code{@pmutation}.}

\item{parent}{An integer index indicating which individual in the population to mutate.}

\item{...}{Further arguments (unused, included for compatibility).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector representing the mutated individual.
}
\description{
Applies mutation to a selected parent vector by replacing each gene with a random value
(within bounds) with a given mutation probability. Used in integer-encoded GAs.
